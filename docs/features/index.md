# Features

C-mantic helps make C/C++ development less tedious by providing code generation for VS code, in the form of [Code Actions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring). Relevant code-actions are suggested via the light-bulb menu ðŸ’¡ as you navigate/edit your source code. The list of possible code-actions can be accessed directly by selecting `Refactor...` or `Source Actions...` in the editor context menu (right-click). Code-actions can also be invoked directly as commands through the command palette, which can be configured with keyboard shortcuts.

Here's more info about C-mantic's [Refactorings]({{ site.url }}/vscode-cmantic/features/refactorings/) and [Source Actions]({{ site.url }}/vscode-cmantic/features/source-actions/).
