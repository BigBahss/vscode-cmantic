# Switch Header/Source in Workspace

The `Switch Header/Source in Workspace` command will open and switch to the header/source file that corresponds to the active file. C-mantic will only look for matching header/source files within the current workspace, which may offer better accuracy over other implementations. You can control whether or not this appears in the editor context menu with the setting `Context Menu: Switch Header Source`.
