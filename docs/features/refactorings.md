# Refactorings

Some of C-mantic's refactorings are suggested via the light-bulb menu ðŸ’¡ as you navigate/edit your source code. However, some must be manually selected through the `Refactor...` menu, which is available in the editor context menu (right-click). Check out the documentation on each refactoring below for more info on how they can be activated. C-mantic's refactorings are also available through the command palette or by keyboard shortcut.
