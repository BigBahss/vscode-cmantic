# Source Actions

Source Action's are code-actions that apply to the whole file. Therefore, source-actions are not suggested in the light-bulb menu ðŸ’¡ and must be manually selected through the `Source Actions...` menu, which is available in the editor context menu (right-click). C-mantic's source-actions are also available through the command palette or by keyboard shortcut.
